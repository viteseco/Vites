### VITES Coin
Vites is an open source cryptocurrency based on the [Nist5](https://coinguides.org/nist5-algorithm-coins-asic/) algorithm. The Vites cryptocurrency serves as the core utility coin in the Vites platform and related use cases. The emphasis of Vites is solely on creating solid use cases and a functional digital economy around the cryptocurrency.
 
Nowadays most cryptocurrencies serve solely as speculative assets, out of which most essentially just focus on Bitcoin being faster, cheaper, anonymous or to feature some kind of other gimmick. This leads to a significant lack of real world utility which could and most definitely should come from the use of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies can only be adopted as a proper currency if they are usable in many different business environments. In addition, a cryptocurrency must be easy to obtain and utilize by new/less tech savvy users.
 
The Vites project has a strong focus on providing actual utility with low barriers for new adopters. Vites will push its adoption primarily through its namesake Vites platform, which will essentially be a digital economy where you can earn or spend the Vites cryptocurrency.
 
Users can enter the world of cryptocurrency by doing things already common in today’s world, rather than having to purchase cryptocurrency outright or mine, a process seen by many outsiders as difficult.
 
Through the Vites platform, the user can then be exposed to, and incentivised to learn more about, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency as a whole.

And we’re going to explore the benefits of adding masternodes. All the changes within- or after the first year will be for the health of the project.
